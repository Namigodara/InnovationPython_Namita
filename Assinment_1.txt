Q4 : How many types of version control systems are there?
Ans: There are two types of version control systems
      1. Centralized :
                      In this all the changes are made to one center project
                      copy and you will commit all the changes to it. You will
                      never have the full history of the project.
      2. Distributed:
                      In distributed version control system you can clone the
                      full project/ repository to your local server and then you
                      will have the full history of the project. You do not relay
                      on a central server.
