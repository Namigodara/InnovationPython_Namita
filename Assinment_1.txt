Q2:  What are the difference between Git and Github?
Ans:  Git is a tool which is used for version control.
      It is installed locally on user's machine.
      And gives command line to perform various operations required for version control.
      While Github is a cloud based online server that stores the code pushed from local machine using Git tool (or any similar tool).
      It is open source.
